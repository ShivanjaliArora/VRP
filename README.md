# VRP
This project showcases the development of an optimization solution for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) utilizing genetic algorithms. The VRP is a common logistics challenge in production and distribution businesses, where the goal is to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations.

Project Highlights
Algorithm Development: Created an optimization solution that efficiently handles the logistics of VRP.
Library Utilization: Extensively used the DEAP library to experiment with and implement evolutionary computation techniques.
Visualization: Used Matplotlib to produce clear and insightful visualizations of routing solutions.
